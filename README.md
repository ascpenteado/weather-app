## My Goals and what I've practiced

My goal was to create a simple UI that delivers easily the main information about weather. This was a good opportunity to work with Chart.js and Toastify.
I've used a backend Node.js API to fetch the data from OpenWeather.

Any feedback will be appreciated :)

### Requirements

- Create a React app
- An input for users to type city name
- Display current weather including weather condition, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and date and time
- Visualization to display the temperature change, humidity change, and weather conditions of each day

### Technologies

- React JS
- Tailwind
- Open Weather Api
- Chart.js
- Toastify
- Luxon (for Dates)
